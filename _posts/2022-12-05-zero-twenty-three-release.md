**Last updated:** December 05, 2022.

![Release 0.23.0](../assets/posts/release_0_23_0/Release_0.23.0.jpg)

Let's dive right into the changes.

## ü™ê neptune.ai Integration
The biggest new we have for you this release is the new [neptune.ai](https://neptune.ai/) integration!

This integration includes an experiment tracker component that allows you to track your machine learning experiments
using neptune.ai.

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

This release brings about a huge boost in performance! What used to take minutes now takes seconds to complete.
We did this by significantly reducing the amount of server calls.
The huge performance boost is obvious in the now blazing fast CLI and [ZenML Dashboard](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-dashboard).


## üôå So long, PyArrow

We've removed PyArrow as a dependency of the `zenml` Python package.

As a consequence of that, our `NumPy` and `Pandas` materializer no
longer read and write their artifacts using PyArrow but instead use
native formats instead. 

If you still want to use `PyArrow` to serialize
your `NumPy` arrays and `Pandas` dataframes, you'll need to install it manually with 

```bash
pip install pyarrow
```

This results in a slimmer and lighter version of `zenml`.
In our upcoming releases, we aim to remove more unnecessary dependencies to slim down the `zenml` package even further.


## üíî Breaking Changes

The following changes introduces with this release mey require some manual
intervention to update your current installations:

- If your code calls some methods of our `Client` class, it might need to be
updated to the new model classes introduced by the performance optimization changes
explained above
- The CLI command to remove an attribute from a stack component now takes no more dashes
in front of the attribute names:
`zenml stack-component remove-attribute <COMPONENT_NAME> <ATTRIBUTE_NAME>`
- If you're using a custom stack component and have overridden the `cleanup_step_run` method,
you'll need to update the method signature to include a `step_failed` parameter.
