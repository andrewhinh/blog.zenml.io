As we are in the early stages of developing zenml our codebase is quickly growing, evolving and changing. Within this exciting setting of ideating and restructuring it 
can be difficult to ensure that our examples stay operational and relevant. However, these examples are an important way for our users to 
learn how to use zenml. In order to address this issue we have decided to write integration-tests for all of our examples.
