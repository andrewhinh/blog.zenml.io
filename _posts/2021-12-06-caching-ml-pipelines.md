Data is the lifeblood that feeds machine learning models. The process of developing those models requires data in different forms. During the early lifecycle stages of any particular model, particularly when experimenting with different approaches, this data will get used repeatedly.

Machine learning model development is extremely iterative in this way. Data scientists are constantly repeating steps in slightly different combinations. Given that data often is imported or transformed in the course of these steps, it would be good to find a way to minimise wasted work. Luckily, we can use caching to save the day.

If we organise the steps of our model training smartly, we can ensure that the data outputs and inputs along the way are cached. A good way to think about splitting up the steps is to use the image of [pipelines](https://blog.zenml.io/tag/pipelines/) and the steps that are executed. For each step, data is passed in, and (potentially) gets returned. We can cache the data at these entry and exit points. If we rerun the pipeline we will only rerun an individual step if something has changed in the implementation, otherwise we can just use the cached output value.

## Benefits of Caching

I hope some of the benefits of caching are clear to you now.

- **üîÅ Iteration Efficiency** - When experimenting, it really pays to have a high frequency of iteration. You learn when and how to course correct earlier and more often. Caching brings you closer to that by making the costs of frequent iteration much lower.
- **üí™ Increased Productivity** - The speed-up in iteration frequency will help you solve problems faster, making stakeholders happier and giving you a greater feeling of agency in your machine learning work.
- **üå≥ Environmental Friendliness** - Caching saves you the [needless repeated computation steps](https://machinelearning.piyasaa.com/greening-ai-rebooting-the-environmental-harms-of-machine/) which mean you use up and waste less energy. It all adds up!
- **ÔºÑ Reduced Costs** - Your bottom-line will thank you! Not only do you save the planet, but your monthly cloud bills might be lower on account of your skipping those repeated steps.

## Get caching for free with ZenML pipelines

ZenML takes care of caching the artifacts that either come in or are output from the steps of your machine learning pipeline. We build on top of the caching that `tfx` enables through its [`MLMetadataStore`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/mlmd), a library that stores information about the pipeline steps and the artifacts that are output.
