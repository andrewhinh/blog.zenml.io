With ZenML 0.7.0, a lot has been revamped under the hood about how things are
stored. Importantly what this means is that ZenML now has system-wide profiles
that let you register stacks to share across several of your projects! If you
still want to manage your stacks for each project folder individually, profiles
still let you do that as well.

Most projects of any complexity will require passwords or tokens to access data
and infrastructure, and for this purpose ZenML 0.7.0 introduces the Secrets
Manager stack component to seamlessly pass around these values to your steps.
Our AWS integration also allows you to use AWS Secrets Manager as a backend to
handle all your secret persistence needs.

Finally, in addition to the new AzureML and Sagemaker Step Operators that
[version 0.6.3](zero-six-three-release) brought, this release also
adds the ability to run individual steps on GCP's Vertex AI.

Beyond this, some smaller bugfixes and documentation changes combine to make
ZenML 0.7.0 a more pleasant user experience. For a detailed look at what's
changed, give [our full release notes](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/releases/tag/0.7.0)
